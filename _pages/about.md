👩‍💻 I'm a master's student in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University.

📚 My study focuses on Natural Language Processing, with additional knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science.


# 🤖 SKILLS

**Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
**Programming Frameworks:** PyTorch, Sklearn, Transformers, NLTK, Huggingface, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Technologies:** Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Text Generation, Image Classification, Supervised Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning
**Languages:** Mandarin Chinese (Native), English (C1), German(A2-B1) 

## 📜 EXAMPLE REPORTS/PROJECTS
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
