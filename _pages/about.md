üë©‚Äçüíª I'm a master's student in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University.

üìö My study focuses on Natural Language Processing, with additional knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science.

## üíª EXAMPLE REPORTS/PROJECTS
### Natural Language Processing
- **[Comparative Analysis of BERT Variants on Sentiment Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13RJ4inZYD4eEdOVK9lHhEQ64VAs1WgSs/view):** Compare BERT-base with RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT by adding one linear layer to the pre-trained models, focusing on their performance and efficiency in sentiment analysis. Metrics like accuracy, F1-scores, and training time were used for evaluation.
- **[Comparative Analysis of Sentiment Analysis Techniques and Preprocessing Impact: NLTK/VADER, SpaCy/TextBlob, and HuggingFace](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hioeSSo9hQ_g_aQTISfR2UZtYFH4GR57/view?usp=sharing):** A comparative study on sentiment analysis tasks executed using NLTK/VADER, SpaCy/Textblob, and HuggingFace. We analyzed the results obtained from two versions of code. The impact of preprocessing steps, and sentiment analysis methods on the performance was assessed through confusion matrices generated by all three models.
- **[IT Service Ticket Classification with DistilBERT](https://github.com/yyuuccii/TextClassification_ITService/tree/main):** Classify IT service tickets into predefined categories by the descriptions of IT problems using a DistilBERT-based model. The model architecture includes a pre-trained DistilBERT as a feature extractor, followed by a custom classifier composed of fully connected layers with ReLU activations and dropout for regularization, achieving a test accuracy of 74.73%.
- **[Yoga Pose Classification with custom CNN, ResNet50, and MobileNet](https://github.com/yyuuccii/ImageClassification_YogaPose):** Explore yoga pose classification using three models: a custom CNN, ResNet50, and MobileNet. The custom CNN, designed with four convolutional layers and five fully connected layers, achieves a test accuracy of approximately 55.24%. The ResNet50 and MobileNet model, leveraging pretrained weights with fine-tuning, reaches a test accuracy of around 72.18% and 70.97%, respectively.
