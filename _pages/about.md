👩‍💻 I'm a master's student in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University.

📚 My study focuses on Natural Language Processing, with additional knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science.

## 💻 EXAMPLE REPORTS/PROJECTS
- **[Comparative Analysis of BERT Variants on Sentiment Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13RJ4inZYD4eEdOVK9lHhEQ64VAs1WgSs/view):** Compare BERT-base with RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT by adding one linear layer to the pre-trained models, focusing on their performance and efficiency in sentiment analysis. Metrics like accuracy, F1-scores, and training time were used for evaluation.
