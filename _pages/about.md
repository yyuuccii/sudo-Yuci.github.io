👩‍💻 I'm a master's student in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University.

📚 My study focuses on Natural Language Processing, with additional knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science.


# 🤖 SKILLS

**Programming Languages**: Python, SQL

**Programming Frameworks:** PyTorch, Sklearn, Transformers, NLTK, Huggingface, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Technologies:** Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Text Generation, Image Classification, Supervised Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning

**Languages:** Mandarin Chinese (Native), English (C1), German(A2-B1) 

## 📜 EXAMPLE REPORTS/PROJECTS
- **Comparative Analysis of BERT Variants on Sentiment Analysis:** Compare BERT-base with RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and ALBERT by adding one linear layer to the pre-trained models, focusing on their performance and efficiency in sentiment analysis. Metrics like accuracy, F1-scores, and training time were used for evaluation [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13RJ4inZYD4eEdOVK9lHhEQ64VAs1WgSs/view].

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
